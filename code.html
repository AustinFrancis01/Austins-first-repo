        <h1>Building this form!</h1>
        <h2>What it took...</h2>
        <p>Making this small form took in total about 12 full work hours</p>
        <p>The idea came about when one night I had realized the only things I had ever really made while on my jorney to become a developer were just small landing sites that never really did anything but look nice.  So I decided I would make something small and attainable that could actually have features that work and had value.  <br>So with all of that being said, all of the answers that are submitted will be sent straight to my email through a back-end API using JavaScript. <br>Thank you for your feedback!</p>
